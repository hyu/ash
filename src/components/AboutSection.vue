      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I'm a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW). Much of my training is psychoanalytically oriented, and I trained and worked at the EMDR Trauma Treatment Center at the National Institute for the Psychotherapies.</p>
      
      <p>I offer supervision to early career therapists and social work graduate students, and am SIFI certified. I also enjoy teaching clinicians. Recently I've taught seminars on conducting trauma-informed intakes, and on the value of patients' right to refuse aspects of EMDR therapy.</p>
      
      <p>Reach out to schedule a consultation.</p>
      
      <h3>Insurance</h3>
      <p>I will work with you to use your out-of-network benefits. I provide you with a superbill to submit to your insurance to be reimbursed either all or a portion of the fee.</p>
      
      <h3>In Person</h3>
      <p>My practice is fully in-person. Office is on the Greenpoint / Williamsburg border in Brooklyn</p>
      
      <p>5-minute walk from the Nassau Avenue G Train, and a 20-minute walk from the Bedford Avenue L Train</p>
      
      <p>Virtual sessions are available when illness, travel, or emergencies prevent us from being in-person.</p>
