      <p>Therapy is a space for restoring trust in our instincts.</p>
      <p>From there, we find our way to action, pleasure, creativity, and rest.</p>
      <p>More and more, we allow ourselves to exist, connect with others, and become alive.</p>

    <h3>Therapy</h3>
    <p>Whether you're experienced in doing this work or if you're coming to therapy for the first time, together we'll find our way into a conversation. Through conversation, the therapy emerges. Learn more.</p>
    
    <h3>EMDR & Adjunctive</h3>
    <p>EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy targets traumatic stress symptoms. Specifically flashbacks, avoidance of triggers, and intrusive thoughts.</p>
    <p>If you are already in an ongoing therapy and want to add EMDR to your process, I offer adjunctive EMDR. Learn more.</p>
