    <p><strong>INDIVIDUAL THERAPY</strong></p>
    <p>Whether you're experienced doing this work or if you're trying therapy for the first time, together we'll find our way into a conversation. Through conversation, the therapy emerges.</p>
    
    <p>In individual therapy we meet one or more times weekly. I work with adults age 18 and up. Reach out to schedule a consultation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>STYLE</strong></p>
    <p>In our conversation, I tend to be an active participant while making a lot of space for you to explore.</p>
    
    <p>I weave together the two therapeutic styles that I actively train in:</p>
    
    <p>The first is psychodynamic, with the focus on your history, relationships, personality, style of conversing, dreams, and fantasies.</p>
    
    <p>The second is a more directed, body-oriented approach, sometimes referred to as "experiential therapy" or "trauma therapy."</p>
    
    <p>I am queer- and trans-affirming, and experienced working with people in non-monogamous relationship structures.</p>
    
    <p>I also offer EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), learn more.</p>
    
    <p><strong>IN-PERSON</strong></p>
    <p>My practice is fully in-person. Office is on the Greenpoint / Williamsburg border in Brooklyn</p>
    
    <p>5-minute walk from the Nassau Avenue G Train, and a 20-minute walk from the Bedford Avenue L Train</p>
    
    <p>Virtual sessions are available when illness, travel, or emergencies prevent us from being in-person.</p>
